This folder contains the code of the NSIP method with gauss-hermite quadrature. The output of the 
code is the reference erro that we discussed.

To use it just create a folder with all these routines and open main.py. Run it. To compute the different kinds of errors edit 
nonIntrusive_test.py. 

ALL THE OTHER ROUTINES SHOULD BE WORKING FINE! JUST EDIT nonIntrusive.py!
